# Hi-Vibe

- The name of the application is "Hi-Vibe" and it's a chat application where people are chatting with each other trhu messages and some extra features like photo sharing and emoji's. The concept of this app is pretty straightforward, a person that owns an account for this app can log in the app and start chatting with any person from their list of friends. If a person wants to reach another person that is not in his/her friends list, it will search for its name or nickname into a specific search bar, so that if an existing account of that person is found then it can readily be sent a friend request and after accepting it a new conversation cand be started. The main goal of the "Hi-Vibe" app is to simulate the working process of the most famous nowadays applications like "What's app", "Messenger" and so on.
